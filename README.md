# RL-Based E-commerce Recommendation System

## Overview
A production-ready recommendation system using Reinforcement Learning, specifically designed to showcase understanding of both RL theory and practical ML engineering for AI/ML research engineer interviews.

## Why Reinforcement Learning for Recommendations?

Traditional recommendation systems use:
- **Collaborative Filtering**: "Users like you also liked..."
- **Content-Based**: "You liked X, here's similar Y"

**But they miss something crucial:** They don't optimize for long-term user engagement or adapt quickly to user feedback.

### RL Advantages:
1. **Online Learning**: Adapts in real-time as users interact
2. **Exploration-Exploitation**: Balances showing proven items vs discovering new preferences
3. **Sequential Decision Making**: Optimizes for session/lifetime value, not just next click
4. **Cold Start Handling**: Systematic exploration helps with new items/users

## Project Architecture

```

## Learning Path

### Week 1: Contextual Bandits
**Goal**: Implement industry-standard approach

**Concepts to master:**
- Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB)
- Exploration vs Exploitation
- Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)
- Contextual bandits (LinUCB, Neural bandits)

**Implementation:**
- Start with simple ε-greedy
- Implement UCB1
- Build LinUCB (linear contextual bandit)
- Compare against baseline (popularity, random)

### Week 2-3: Deep Reinforcement Learning
**Goal**: Understand state-of-the-art research approaches

**Concepts to master:**
- MDP formulation for recommendations
- Q-learning and Deep Q-Networks (DQN)
- Policy gradient methods
- Slate recommendations (recommending multiple items)

**Implementation:**
- Formulate recommendation as MDP
- Implement DQN with experience replay
- Try policy gradient (REINFORCE or A2C)
- Compare with contextual bandits

### Week 3-4: Production & Presentation
**Goal**: Make it interview-ready

- REST API for serving recommendations
- Evaluation metrics (CTR, diversity, novelty)
- A/B testing simulation
- Jupyter notebooks with analysis
- README with insights and learnings

## Key Interview Talking Points

1. **Why RL over traditional methods?**
   - Online learning and adaptation
   - Principled exploration
   - Long-term optimization

2. **Exploration-Exploitation Tradeoff**
   - Too much exploration: Poor short-term performance
   - Too much exploitation: Miss better items, get stuck
   - Solution: UCB, Thompson Sampling, ε-decay

3. **Challenges in RL Recommendations**
   - Large action spaces (millions of products)
   - Sparse rewards (most items never clicked)
   - Off-policy evaluation (can't A/B test everything)
   - Cold start for new items/users

4. **Practical Considerations**
   - Computational efficiency at scale
   - Handling biased logged data
   - Balancing multiple objectives (clicks, purchases, engagement)
   - Fairness and filter bubbles

## Dataset

We'll use the **RetailRocket** dataset or **Amazon product reviews**:
- User-item interactions (views, add-to-cart, purchases)
- Item features (category, price, descriptions)
- Temporal data (session-based interactions)

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3.8+**
- **NumPy, Pandas**: Data processing
- **Scikit-learn**: Feature engineering, baseline models
- **Vowpal Wabbit** or **custom**: Contextual bandits
- **PyTorch**: Deep RL implementation
- **Gym**: RL environment wrapper
- **FastAPI**: Serving API
- **Matplotlib, Plotly**: Visualization

## Success Metrics

1. **Learning Efficiency**: How quickly the agent improves
2. **Click-Through Rate (CTR)**: % of recommended items clicked
3. **Diversity**: Variety of items recommended (avoid filter bubble)
4. **Novelty**: Recommend items user hasn't seen
5. **Cumulative Reward**: Long-term user satisfaction
